# Overview

Typescript Project

This is a typescript project that is a spinoff from the popular board game "Clue" with a focus on allowing users to create their own custom cards in the mystery. Integrates with a node js api to interact with a postgres database.

Wrote this program for my fiance becuase she loves the game "Clue". I built this so I could create custom cards that have significant meaning to our relationship. It is a love letter sort of thing but more nerdy.
